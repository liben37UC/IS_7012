Passenger numbers shrank quickly with fears of submarines, which were sighted by      the RMS Baltic on several occasions. On 1 January 1916 she arrived in New York with $35,000,000 in gold bullion.      Later in 1916 she was used in transporting the Canadian Expeditionary Force from Halifax to Britain.</p>     <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/RMS_Baltic_postcard.jpg" width="300" height="191" alt="ship2">     <p>Baltic was the vessel used to deliver Major General John J.
